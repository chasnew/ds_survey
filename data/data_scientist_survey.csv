Even though I (personally) actually learn in-depth linear algebra before in-depth statistic, I found that learning statistic is very important for data scientist as more often than not, we have to design model such that match our prior assumption. The linear algebra and differential calculus came later as a tool to analyze our model. However, for some system (such as dynamic system), if prior statistic is not known, using differential calculus actually become very useful. In conclusion, I think both are crucial but the order for learning is more align with personal preference"
